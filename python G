Sure, Teto! Could you clarify what kind of script you need for your repository? For example:
- Is it a setup script (e.g., install.sh, setup.py)?
- A README script to explain usage?
- A security or automation script (e.g., for backups, monitoring, or scanning)?
- What language should it be in (e.g., Bash, Python, PowerShell)?
- What is the repository's purpose (e.g., cybersecurity tools, academic project, system utilities)?
Once I have that context, I can generate a tailored and well-commented script for you. Here's a quick example of a basic Python setup script:
# setup.py - Basic setup script for a Python repository

from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(
    name='my_project',
    version='1.0.0',
    author='Teto',
    description='A cybersecurity tool for detecting phishing URLs',
    packages=find_packages(),
    install_requires=[
        'requests',
        'beautifulsoup4',
        'scikit-learn',
        'pandas'
    ],
    entry_points={
        'console_scripts': [
            'phish-detector=src.main:run'
        ]
    },
    classifiers=[
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3',
        'License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License',
        'Operating System :: OS Independent',
    ],
)


Let me know the exact purpose and environment, and I’ll tailor it perfectly for your needs.
